def circumference(radius):
    pi = 3.14159265359
    #The above value defines pi to allow for easier calculation.
    solution = 2*pi*radius
    #Solution is the formula to calculate the circumference.
    return solution
    #this will allow the answer to the formula to be solved.
#The above prompt will calculate the circumference of a circle if provided with the radius of the circle using print(circumference()) to find it.
