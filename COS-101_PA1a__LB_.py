#The Surface area of a sphere is calculated by determining the multiplication of 4, π, and the radius of 10 twice
π = 3.14
#this provides a value for π
print('the formula for π is 3.14')
#this command allows the computer to let the user know what π stands for in the formula
r = 10
#this provides a value for r
print('the radius of the sphere is equal to 10')
#this command allows the computer to let the user know what r stands for in the formula
surface_area = 4*π*r**2
#this provides a formula for the surface_area command
print('surface area for sphere is 4πr**2')
#this command allows the computer to let the user know what the formula for the sphere's surface area is
print('surface area of the sphere is equal to', surface_area)
#this command tells the user what the surface area of the sphere is and calculates what the surface area is of the sphere
